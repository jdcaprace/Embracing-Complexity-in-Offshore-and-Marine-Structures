\subsection{Compactness complexity â€“- $C_{cp}$}
The shape complexity, is a numerical amount that represents the degree to which a shape is compact. At times called "shape factor" or "compactness". This study supposed that a steel part has a complex form (non-compact), which is more difficult to manufacture.


In the literature, the researchers used various compactness measures for 2D shapes and 3D solids, \cite{valentan2008}. These classical measurements of shape complexity for 2D shape it relates in large part to the perimeter and surface area, besides for 3D solids relates in large part to the enclosing surface area and volume.


\cite{valentan2008} states that a combination of the existing methods with others currently in development provided an accurate assessment of the complexity shape, and determines appropriate manufacturing procedures regarding to the evaluation.


For 3D shapes, the most usual shape complexity measure is the sphericity (see equation \ref{EqShapeComplexity3D}), is the ratio of the lateral surface of a sphere (with the same volume as the given solid) to the surface area of a 3D solid, defined by \cite{wadell1935volume}. %******RETIRADO*****
This ratio is maximum (=1) for a sphere and minimum (=0) for an infinitely long and narrow shape.


\begin{equation}
\psi = \frac{A_s}{A}= \frac{\pi^{1/3}(6V)^{2/3}}{A}
\label{EqShapeComplexity3D}
\end{equation}


\begin{tabularx}
where		& $\psi$ 	& is the \textit{sphericity},\\
				& $A$		& is the lateral surface of the solid,\\
				& $A_s$	& is the lateral surface of the sphere,\\
				& $V$		& is the volume of the solid.
\end{tabularx}


Finally, it can be calculated the shape complexity $C_{sh}$ for each individual steel component of the ship with the equation \ref{EqShapeComplexityIndFinal}. The average shape complexity of a set of parts such as a ship assembly can be calculated  with the equation \ref{EqShapeComplexityAvgFinal}.


	
\begin{equation}
C_{cp} = 1 - \psi
\label{EqShapeComplexityIndFinal}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
C_{cp} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (1-\psi_{n})}{n}
\label{EqShapeComplexityAvgFinal}
\end{equation}


\begin{tabularx}
where		& $C_{cp}$ & is the shape complexity,\\ 
				& $\psi$ 	& is the \textit{sphericity} or the \textit{circularity ratio},\\
				& $n$		& is the number of part inside the assembly.\\
\end{tabularx}
