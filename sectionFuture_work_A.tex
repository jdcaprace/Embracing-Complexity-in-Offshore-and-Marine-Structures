\section{Future work}
As an important part of shipbuilding, outfitting refers to the process of fabrication and installation of non-structural components, including the main propulsion system, pumps and piping systems, electrical system, air conditioning, etc. In many instances and especially for offshore structures, outfitting represents as much as 50\% of the cost of the ship and also as much as 50\% ship construction time. However, as a result of the disturbances by unexpected delays, system variations, capacity limitations, and technological constraints, scheduling of outfitting processes is very complex and can delay the entire ship production system.

Therefore, next development will focus the improvement of the outfitting complexity assessment considering not only piping but also electrical systems, HVAC, specific offshore equipment's, etc.

Prpose to apply that for warships surface vessels and submarines ???
