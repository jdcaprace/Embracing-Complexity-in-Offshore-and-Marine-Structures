  Abstract                 = {Oil companies are gradually becoming more focused on optimizing their upstream logistics. However, little research regarding upstream logistics has been published. We argue that more research would be beneficial and that more attention must be given to one of the largest cost elements in the upstream chain ***INVALID BYTE SEQUENCE HERE*** the supply vessels. We explore the supply vessel as a means of transport and carry out a logistics analysis based on their use on the Norwegian continental shelf. Carrying capacity, sailing, loading and unloading capabilities are established as the main features of a supply vessel. Thereafter we discuss relevant logistical trade-offs within and among these features, and also in relation to the environment the vessels operate in. This elaboration clearly shows the complexity involved when searching for the ***INVALID BYTE SEQUENCE HERE***optimal***INVALID BYTE SEQUENCE HERE*** supply vessel. The analysis also indicates the design and logistics system features that should be challenged in the future. We believe that the findings in this article will be of considerable value for both practitioners and academics.},

  Abstract                 = {Decisions taken during the initial design stage determine 60\% to 95\% of the total cost of a product. So there is a significant need to concurrently consider performance, cost, production and design complexity issues at the early stages of the design process. The main obstacle to this approach is the lack of convenient and reliable cost and performance models that can be integrated into a complex design process as is used in the shipbuilding industry. Traditional models and analysis methods frequently do not provide the required sensitivity to consider all the important variables impacting performance, cost, production and ship***INVALID BYTE SEQUENCE HERE***s life cycle. Our challenge is that achieving this sensitivity at the early design stage almost requires data available during the detail design analysis. The traditional design methods do not adequately include, early enough, production and life cycle engineering to have a positive impact on the design. Taking an integrated approach throughout the life cycle of the ship and using concurrent engineering analysis tools can improve these traditional design process weaknesses. Innovation is required in structural design and cost assessment. The use of design for X, and particular design for production and cost schemes, during the design is the solution: to reduce failure during a ship***INVALID BYTE SEQUENCE HERE***s life caused by design misconception, to reduce the overall design time and to shorten the build cycle of ships, to enlarge the number of design alternatives during the design process. The author has developed some assessment methods for cost effectiveness and complexity measurements intended to be used by ship designers for the real time control of cost process. The outcome is that corrective actions can be taken by management in a rather short time to actually improve or overcome predicted unfavourable performance. Fundamentally, these methods will provide design engineers with objective and quantifiable cost and complexity measures making it possible to take rational design decisions throughout the design stages. The measures proposed in this PhD are based on several techniques like decision analysis, data mining, neural network, fuzzy logic. They are objective facts, which are not dependent on the engineer***INVALID BYTE SEQUENCE HERE***s interpretation of information, but rather on a model generated to represent the ship design. The objectivity aspect is essential when using the complexity and cost measures in a design automation system. Finally, with these tools, the designers should obtain well-defined and unambiguous metrics for measurement of the different types of cost effectiveness and complexities in engineered artefacts. Such metrics help the designers and design automation tools to be objective and perform quantitative comparisons of alternative design solutions, cost estimation, as well as design optimization. In this PhD, these metrics have been applied and validated with success in real industrial conditions on the design of passenger ships.},

To improve the shipbuilding system efficiency in the presence of variation, a two-stage strategic-level outfitting planning model has been developed. The results of the model provide the optimal percentage of outfitting work that should be completed at each stage given the introduction of variation. The model presented can be used as a benchmark for current ship-outfitting management decisions.},

  Abstract                 = {This article approaches the complexity aspects of conceptual ship design from a systems engineering point of view. We introduce the issue by defining the term complexity in systems engineering, placing the conceptual ship design task as a complex system problem and creating analogies between generic complex systems and a ship. Five main aspects of complexity are presented, linking challenges of the conceptual phase to each of the aspects. The structural aspect is related to the arrangement and interrelationship of the physical objects in the ship. The behavioral aspect derives from the form-function mapping. The external circumstances to which the ship is subjected are approached through the contextual aspect. Uncertainties in the scenarios and changes over time are related to the temporal aspect. The perceptual aspect relates to how stakeholders perceive the value that they receive from a chosen design. A theoretical study to address these five aspects is presented, applying the responsive systems comparison method in the conceptual design of an anchor handling a tug supply vessel. The last section discusses why decomposing the complexities of the ship design task in five aspects is a benefit.},

Manufacturing is facing unprecedented challenges due to increased variety, market volatility and distributed global manufacturing. A fundamental residue of globalization and market uncertainty is the increasing complexity of manufacturing, technological and economic systems. The nature and sources of complexity in these areas are reviewed and complexity modeling and management approaches are discussed. Enterprises that can mitigate the negative aspects of complexity while managing its positives should thrive on the continuous change and increasing complexity. To reap these benefits in the future, manufacturing companies need to not only adopt flexible technical solutions but must also effectively innovate and manage complex socio-technical systems. },

  Abstract                 = {Aerospace system requirements over the last decade have continued to evolve toward higher levels of performance at lower cost, incurring a major challenge for system developers; how to balance conflicting performance and cost requirements and understand their impact on performance margins as well as the manufacturability characteristics of the design. This paper presents results of a case study performed on an aerospace air turbine starter system in which a top-level systems engineering methodology has been developed to help understand the impact that customer requirements and design decisions have on manufacturing trade space constraints. One of the major findings of this case study is that incremental increases in performance requirements can drive step change increases in manufacturing cost due to discontinuities in the material and process trade space, i.e. using titanium versus aluminum to meet temperature requirements or having to use investment versus sand castings to meet minimum thickness and tolerance requirements. Internally developed quantitative producibility analysis tools are also used to characterize the complexity and Design for Manufacturability (DFM) characteristics of the ***INVALID BYTE SEQUENCE HERE***similar to***INVALID BYTE SEQUENCE HERE*** baseline design to identify producibility improvement opportunities for the new design as part of the proposed systems engineering process to mitigate design reuse risks. },

The extension of the design process to include the design for production activity has the following primary objectives: to produce a design that represents an acceptable compromise between the demands of performance and production and, where appropriate, take into account the needs of overhaul, repair and maintenance; to ensure that all design features are compatible with known characteristics of the shipyard facilities; to apply the individual design for production principles and procedures insofar as they are relevant to the particular vessel and to the particular shipyard where the vessel is to be built, and to co-ordinate the inter-relationship between the machinery, electrical and outfitting work with the structural work, in order to create a fully integrated design model. It is, of course, vital that design for production effort starts early in the design process. The designer has the greatest influence on the cost of the vessel during the earliest design stages when primary parts, materials and equipment and the basic configuration are being decided. The influence the designer has on cost drops off quite rapidly in the later design stages.},

This metric is comprised of seven separate producibility drivers that are dependent on the properties of the panel. The new producibility metric is compared with a traditional costing method in a two-objective genetic algorithm to show that there is a competition between the two methods, meaning that the new metric gives a designer additional information at the early design stage. The estimated costs versus producibility scores for several grillage sizes show that large gains in producibility can be made without large increases in estimated costs up until a critical point where a knee in the Pareto front occurs. Furthermore, it was found that the individual producibility elements are highly dependent on the size of the panel tested and the constraints the panel must meet. In general, producibility is a key factor to be considered in structural design and should be accounted for in any structural optimization.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Complexity theory has increasingly been discussed and applied within evaluation literature over the past decade. This article reviews the discussion and use of complexity theory within academic journal literature. The aim is to identify the issues to be considered when applying complexity theory to evaluation. Reviewing 46 articles, two groups of themes are identified. The first group considers implications of applying complexity theory concepts for defining evaluation purpose, scope and units of analysis. The second group of themes consider methodology and method. Results provide a starting point for a configuration of an evaluation approach consistent with complexity theory, whilst also identifying a number of design considerations to be resolved within evaluation planning. },
