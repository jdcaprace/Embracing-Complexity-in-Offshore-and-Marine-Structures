Reviewer #1: Paper is recommended to be accepted with MAJOR revisions.

Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 should be ENTIRELY modified, avoiding plagiarism and self-plagiarism. Relevant affirmations should be referenced, with proper credit to original authors/publication.

Section 6 seems to be an original case study, and it seems relevant to the scope of the journal. However, given the examples showed, the authors should double check if this part of the manuscript is really an original "first report". 

Notes (from a to g) exemplifying the plagiarism are found in the 5-page .PDF report attached.
